## get_next_line Project Summary

### Project Overview

The `get_next_line` project is a crucial exercise in file reading and manipulation in the C programming language. The goal is to create a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one at a time, until the end of the file. 

### Key Objectives

- Develop a function `get_next_line` capable of reading a line from a file descriptor and returning it without the newline character.
- Manage dynamic memory allocation and deallocation efficiently to prevent memory leaks.
- Ensure the function is robust, adheres to the Norm (42's coding style guide), and is thoroughly tested.

### Core Features

1. **Reading from File Descriptors:**
   - Implement the `get_next_line` function capable of reading lines from multiple file descriptors.

2. **Dynamic Memory Management:**
   - Allocate and deallocate memory dynamically to store and manage data retrieved from file descriptors.

3. **Handling Buffer Sizes:**
   - Efficiently handle different buffer sizes to optimize memory usage and reading performance.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust error handling to manage edge cases and unexpected behaviors gracefully.

### Benefits

- Enhances understanding of file I/O operations in the C programming language.
- Improves proficiency in managing memory dynamically.
- Cultivates problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

### Conclusion

The `get_next_line` project is an essential exercise for mastering file I/O operations and dynamic memory management in C. By successfully completing this project, students at 42 School strengthen their programming skills and gain valuable experience in dealing with real-world programming challenges.
